# 8.0.0-rc.3 (2022-11-05)

### Features

- allow direct resolve
  [#584](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/584) 132e928

### BREAKING CHANGES

- direct resolve was denied because it was problematic together with nested
  injectors support. Nested injectors feature was removed, so we don't have a
  reason to hold to direct resolve restriction as well.

# 8.0.0-rc.2 (2022-11-04)

### Features

- drop nested injectors support
  [#578](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/578) 500385e

### BREAKING CHANGES

- One Injector subclass can not hold another Injector subclass in its attribute.
  This possibility were introduced back in a day too workaround limitation of
  this object. Since this object was not able to reference something outside of
  Injector subclass.

# 8.0.0-rc.1 (2022-11-01)

### Code Refactoring

- drop `this` and `Package` objects support
  [#576](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/576) 0919f36

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `this` and `Package` objects were removed entirely. Use references import
  notation instead. It's syntax is compatible with package import notation.

# 7.1.0 (2021-07-29)

### Features

- implement sticky scopes
  [#311](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/311)

# 7.0.0 (2021-07-21)

### Bug Fixes

- hide scope objects own attributes
  [#514](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/514)
- initialize dependency graph lazily
  [#241](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/241)
- store nested injector spec as scalar data type
  [#510](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/510)

### Features

- deny classes to depend on nested injectors
  [#479](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/479)
- deny resolve nested injector directly
  [#474](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/474)
- deny resolve this objects directly
  [#472](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/472)
- deny to resolve value object directly
  [#473](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/473)
- respect resolution ruses in package objects
  [#471](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/471)
- scalar dependencies can't be resolved directly
  [#480](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/480)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Injector won't pass nested injectors to the constructor of the class. Use
  `this` objects to access inner attributes of nested injector and pass them to
  the constructor arguments.
- The only allowed purpose of nested injectors is to be targets for this
  objects.
- Package objects will conform its resolution rules with imported objects. If
  package dependency points to the class, it's allowed to resolve such
  dependency directly. If package object points to the scalar type for example,
  it'll raise exception if you tries to resolve such dependency directly.
- The only allowed purpose of this objects is to specify dependencies of classes
  and value objects as links to attributes with different names or stored in
  nested Injector classes.
- value objects could only be used to evaluate arguments of classes. Attribute
  access of Injector subclass which result in value object would raise an error.
- Scalar dependencies are basically data types. They are allowed to be used as
  dependencies for other more complicated data types, like classes. If you need
  to take scalar dependency from Injector subclass, use constant value instead.
  You don't need Injector for this.

## 6.0.1 (2021-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

- custom error message for enumerations
  [#121](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/121)

# 6.0.0 (2021-02-12)

### Features

- deprecate [@operation](https://github.com/operation) object
  [#457](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/457)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- @operation object was removed. You could replace it with @value object
  returning inner function. This inner function would use it's closure to
  resolve injected dependencies.

  version of python and libraries we are integrated with as soon as they reach
  official end of life.

## 2.0.1 (2020-07-16)

### Bug Fixes

- compatibility with typing module on Python 3.6

### Features

- remove contrib package closes
  [#192](https://github.com/proofit404/dependencies/issues/192)
