# Why not...

Here we will try to collect pros and cons of different approaches to
make your code extendable and reusable.

Let's imagine we have an order processing system. We want
to implement order purchase feature. There is a lot of functionality
to be built:

- We should change our data,
- send a request to the payment processing system,
- and we should send notification to the user.

## Simple functions

Let's do it with simple functions.

```pycon

>>> def purchase(user, product, shipment_details):
...
...     order = create_order(user, product)
...     final_price = calculate_price(order, shipment_details)
...     payment_details = request_payment(user, shipment_details)
...     notify_user(user, payment_details)

>>> def notify_user(user, payment_details):
...
...     log_notification(user, payment_details)
...     subject = get_notification_subject(payment_details)
...     message = get_notification_text(user, payment_details)
...     send_notification(user, subject, message)

>>> def send_notification(user, subject, message):
...
...     email = get_user_email(user)
...     send_email(email, subject, message)

```

It's a readable and straightforward solution. What can possibly go wrong?

Problem is that this code is difficult to change and extend.

For example, you need to add SMS and push notifications in addition to
plain text emails. To do that, you'll have to add a handful of different
conditions to this simple default path.

Push notification to the mobile app should be written in Markdown
format, SMS requires plain text, and email needs HTML in addition to
plain text. Users should be able to choose their preferred notification
method.

How can we change the code above to match new requirements?

We have problems on all three layers of the code: `purchase`,
`notify_user` and `send_notification` functions have to be changed.

1. **Add conditions to all parameters to all layers of the code.**
   This will end up with messy code which is even harder to extend. No
   one wants `purchase` function to have 12 arguments. No one wants to
   wonder why `send_email` function accepts phone number. No one wants
   to read 7 `if` statements in the `notify_user` function when they
   are about to add eighth condition.
2. **Add context variable instead of another argument.** This little
   `ctx` argument instead of email address, phone number, product
   price and shipment destination will save us a lot of typing between
   function calls. But we still have bunch of `if` statements.
3. **Copy-paste this module and re-implement each feature separately.**
   Each feature will be readable and simple on it's own, but you will
   regret this decision when usage of `request_payment` or
   `calculate_price` changes.

But we still have the same problem. We can't substitute implementation
details of low level code without changing high level policies. Let's
try...

## Inheritance

Let's rewrite our functions into a class which we can subclass for different
purposes.

```pycon

>>> class Order:
...
...     def __init__(self, user, product, shipment_details):
...
...         self.user = user
...         self.product = product
...         self.shipment_details = shipment_details
...         self.final_price = None      # Set by `calculate_price`.
...         self.payment_details = None  # Set by `request_payment`.
...         self.subject = None          # Set by `get_notification_subject`.
...         self.message = None          # Set by `get_notification_text`.
...         self.email = None            # Set by `get_user_email`.
...
...     def purchase(self):
...
...         self.create_order()
...         self.calculate_price()
...         self.request_payment()
...         self.notify_user()
...
...     def notify_user(self):
...
...         self.log_notification()
...         self.get_notification_subject()
...         self.get_notification_text()
...         self.send_notification()
...
...     def send_notification(self):
...
...         self.get_user_email()
...         self.send_email()

```

At first glance, this class is a better solution than before. Indeed, this code has
several advantages.

1. **At first glance high level methods even more readable.** There
   are no nosy arguments or variables. Only nice named methods.
2. **Simple code reuse.** With inheritance, we can override any
   method on any layer of abstraction in the system. We can add any
   number of methods or attributes is the child classes. Looks like it
   is a very reasonable approach.

But this code hides quite a few problems underneath the false premise of understandability
and cleanness.

1. **God object.** One class contains methods related to every single
   layer of abstraction in the system. It's hard to manage two hundred
   methods in the same class: one will process HTTP request, another
   one will send email, and yet another one will write to the database. It's
   hard to figure out what _exactly_ this class does.
2. **Bad state management.** During the life time of a class instance
   different methods change state of the class. When you read short
   method somewhere inside email sender logic, you have no idea _from
   where_ attribute values came from and _when exactly_ they were set. Hello
   `print` statements to understand the code...

Let's reduce amount of logic in the class (responsibility of the class).
Let's try...

## Mixins

We can split our God object into multiple classes and join it together
later using multiple inheritance.

```pycon

>>> class OrderProcessingMixin:
...
...     def create_order(self):
...
...         pass

>>> class PriceCalculationMixin:
...
...     def calculate_price(self):
...
...         pass

>>> class NotificationMixin:
...
...     def get_notification_text(self):
...
...         self.notification_text = self.notification_text_template % (
...             self.user,
...             self.payment_details,
...         )

>>> class Order(OrderProcessingMixin,
...             PriceCalculationMixin,
...             NotificationMixin):
...
...     def before_calculate(self):
...
...         self.create_order()
...
...     def after_commit(self):
...
...         self.send_email()

```

Someone might say this is an improvement over one huge class.

1. **All methods grouped in classes with the same
   responsibility.**
2. **Better code reuse.** We can use the same notification mechanism
   in different classes with just one line of code.

But there are a lot of problems too. During a debugging session,

1. **In the `get_notification_text` you have no idea who set up
   `payment_details`.**
2. **In the `Order` class itself you see a bunch of low level methods
   which are deep implementation details.** What public method should
   I call? When notification will be sent, exactly?

This code is much harder to understand than it should be. Even if it
reusable, this complexity in too large for my head. Let's try...

## Composition

Composition is a powerful pattern of organizing code with proper code
boundaries and clear dependency relationship.

```pycon

>>> class OrderProcessor:
...
...     def create(self, user, product):
...
...         pass

>>> class PriceCalculator:
...
...     def calculate(self, product, shipment_details):
...
...         pass

>>> class PaymentProcessor:
...
...     def request(self, user, shipment_details):
...
...         pass

>>> class Notification:
...
...     def __init__(self, logger):
...
...         self.logger = logger
...
...     def notify(self, user, payment_details):
...
...         self.logger.record(user, payment_details)
...         subject = self.get_notification_subject(payment_details)
...         message = self.get_notification_text(user, payment_details)
...         self.send_notification(user, subject, message)
...
...     def get_notification_subject(self, payment_details):
...
...         pass
...
...     def get_notification_text(self, user, payment_details):
...
...         pass
...
...     def send_notification(self, user, subject, message):
...
...         pass

>>> class Order:
...
...     def __init__(self, order_processor, price_calculator,
...                  payment_processor, notification):
...
...         self.order_processor = order_processor
...         self.price_calculator = price_calculator
...         self.payment_processor = payment_processor
...         self.notification = notification
...
...     def purchase(self, user, product, shipment_details):
...
...         self.order_processor.create(user, product)
...         final_price = self.price_calculator.calculate(product, shipment_details)
...         payment_details = self.payment_processor.request(user, shipment_details)
...         self.notification.notify(user, payment_details)

>>> from app.shop import Logger, User, Product, ShipmentDetails

>>> Order(
...     OrderProcessor(),
...     PriceCalculator(),
...     PaymentProcessor(),
...     Notification(Logger()),
... ).purchase(User(), Product(), ShipmentDetails())

```

This code has a number of really good characteristics.

1. **It's clear where things were defined.** If you try to understand
   what's wrong with your system, you can just use traceback. No nasty
   code execution paths.
2. **Your system becomes really configurable.** You can **inject**
   pretty much any implementation without changing high-level code.

But there one unfortunate consequence of this style

1. **There is too much boilerplate on the initiation stage.**

Let's try...

## Dependencies

Here's where `dependencies` library comes in.

```pycon

>>> from dependencies import Injector

>>> class OrderContainer(Injector):
...
...     order = Order
...     order_processor = OrderProcessor
...     price_calculator = PriceCalculator
...     payment_processor = PaymentProcessor
...     notification = Notification
...     logger = Logger

>>> OrderContainer.order.purchase(User(), Product(), ShipmentDetails())

```

It helps you to reduce the boilerplate of the initiation stage. It
doesn't require you to change your code. You still can instantiate
your classes directly, if you don't like this library.
