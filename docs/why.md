# Why not...

Here we will try to collect pros and cons of different approaches to
make your code extendable and reusable.

Let's imagine we have an order processing system. We want to implement
to implement order purchase feature. There is a lot of functionality
should be implemented. We should change our data, we should send a
request to the payment processing system, we should send notification to
user.

## Simple functions

Let's do it with simple functions

```pycon

>>> def purchase(user, product, shipment_details):
...
...     order = create_order(user, product)
...     final_price = calculate_price(order, shipment_details)
...     payment_details = request_payment(user, shipment_details)
...     notify_user(user, payment_details)

>>> def notify_user(user, payment_details):
...
...     log_notification(user, payment_details)
...     subject = get_notification_subject(payment_details)
...     message = get_notification_text(user, payment_details)
...     send_notification(user, subject, message)

>>> def send_notification(user, subject, message):
...
...     email = get_user_email(user)
...     send_email(email, subject, message)

```

It's readable and straightforward solution. What could possible go
wrong?

It's hard to change and extend this code.

For example you need to add SMS and push notifications in addition to
plain text emails. There is a lot of different conditions added to this
simple default path.

Push notification to the mobile app should be written in the markdown
format, SMS requires plain text, email needed HTML in addition to the
plain text. Users should be able to choice their preferred notification
method.

How we can change this code above to match new requirements?

We have problems on all three layers of your code. All `purchase`,
`notify_user` and `send_notification` should be changed in some way.

1. Add conditions to all parameters to all layers of the code.

   This will end up with messy code which is even harder to extend. No
   one want `purchase` function to have 12 arguments. No one want to
   wonder why `send_email` function accepts phone number. No one want
   to read 7 `if` statements in the `notify_user` function when they
   about to add eighth condition.

2. Add context variable instead of another argument.

   This little `ctx` argument instead of email address, phone number,
   product price and shipment destination will save us a lot of typing
   between function calls. But we still have bunch of `if` statements.

3. Copy-paste this module and reimplement each feature separately.

   Each feature will be readable and simple on it's own, but you will
   regret this decision when usage of the `request_payment` or
   `calculate_price` changed.

But we still have the same problem. We can't substitute implementation
details of low level code without changing high level policies. Let's
try...

## Inheritance

Let's rewrite our functions in the single class so we can alter logic in
the subclasses.

```pycon

>>> class Order:
...
...     def __init__(self, user, product, shipment_details):
...
...         self.user = user
...         self.product = product
...         self.shipment_details = shipment_details
...         self.final_price = None      # Set by `calculate_price`.
...         self.payment_details = None  # Set by `request_payment`.
...         self.subject = None          # Set by `get_notification_subject`.
...         self.message = None          # Set by `get_notification_text`.
...         self.email = None            # Set by `get_user_email`.
...
...     def purchase(self):
...
...         self.create_order()
...         self.calculate_price()
...         self.request_payment()
...         self.notify_user()
...
...     def notify_user(self):
...
...         self.log_notification()
...         self.get_notification_subject()
...         self.get_notification_text()
...         self.send_notification()
...
...     def send_notification(self):
...
...         self.get_user_email()
...         self.send_email()

```

At first look this class is even better solution. Indeed, this code has
few pros.

1. At first glance high level methods even more readable.

   There are no nosy arguments or variables. Only nice named methods.

2. Simple code reuse.

   With inheritance we can simply override any method on any layer of
   abstraction in the system. We can add any number of methods or
   attributes is the child classes. Looks like it is very reasonable
   approach.

But this code has much more hidden cons at more precise analysis.

1. God object.

   One class contains methods related to every single layer of
   abstraction in the system. It's hard to manage two hundred methods
   in the same class. One will process HTTP request, another one will
   send email, another one will write to the database. It's hard to
   figure out what *exactly* this class does.

2. Bad state management.

   During life time of the instance different methods change state of
   the class. When you read short method somewhere inside email sender
   logic you have no idea *from where* attributes came from and *when
   exactly* they were set. Hello `print` statements to understand the
   code...

Let's reduce amount of logic in the class (responsibility of the class).
Let's try...

## Mixins

We can split our God object into multiple classes and join it together
later using multiple inheritance.

```pycon

>>> class OrderProcessingMixin:
...
...     def create_order(self):
...
...         pass

>>> class PriceCalculationMixin:
...
...     def calculate_price(self):
...
...         pass

>>> class NotificationMixin:
...
...     def get_notification_text(self):
...
...         self.notification_text = self.notification_text_template % (
...             self.user,
...             self.payment_details,
...         )

>>> class Order(OrderProcessingMixin,
...             PriceCalculationMixin,
...             NotificationMixin):
...
...     def before_calculate(self):
...
...         self.create_order()
...
...     def after_commit(self):
...
...         self.send_email()

```

Someone might say this is an improvement over one huge class.

1. All methods grouped around classes with the same responsibility.
2. Better code reuse. We can use the same notification mechanism in
   different classes with just one line of code.

But there are a lot of problems too. Imagine you during debugging
session of the `Order` class.

1. In the `get_notification_text` you have no idea who set up
   `payment_details`.
2. In the `Order` class itself you see bunch of low level methods
   which are deep implementation details. What public method I should
   call? When notification will be sent exactly?

This code is much harder to understand than it should be. Even if it
reusable, this complexity in too big for my head. Let's try...

## Composition

Composition is a powerful pattern of organizing code with proper code
boundaries and clear dependency relationship.

```pycon

>>> class OrderProcessor:
...
...     def create(self, user, product):
...
...         pass

>>> class PriceCalculator:
...
...     def calculate(self, product, shipment_details):
...
...         pass

>>> class PaymentProcessor:
...
...     def request(self, user, shipment_details):
...
...         pass

>>> class Notification:
...
...     def __init__(self, logger):
...
...         self.logger = logger
...
...     def notify(self, user, payment_details):
...
...         self.logger.record(user, payment_details)
...         subject = self.get_notification_subject(payment_details)
...         message = self.get_notification_text(user, payment_details)
...         self.send_notification(user, subject, message)
...
...     def get_notification_subject(self, payment_details):
...
...         pass
...
...     def get_notification_text(self, user, payment_details):
...
...         pass
...
...     def send_notification(self, user, subject, message):
...
...         pass

>>> class Order:
...
...     def __init__(self, order_processor, price_calculator,
...                  payment_processor, notification):
...
...         self.order_processor = order_processor
...         self.price_calculator = price_calculator
...         self.payment_processor = payment_processor
...         self.notification = notification
...
...     def purchase(self, user, product, shipment_details):
...
...         self.order_processor.create(user, product)
...         final_price = self.price_calculator.calculate(product, shipment_details)
...         payment_details = self.payment_processor.request(user, shipment_details)
...         self.notification.notify(user, payment_details)

>>> from examples import Logger, User, Product, ShipmentDetails

>>> Order(
...     OrderProcessor(),
...     PriceCalculator(),
...     PaymentProcessor(),
...     Notification(Logger()),
... ).purchase(User(), Product(), ShipmentDetails())

```

This code has few really good characteristics.

1. It's clean where things were defined. If you try to understand
   what's wrong with your system, you can just use traceback. No nasty
   code execution paths.
2. You system became really configurable, you can **inject** pretty
   much any implementation without changing high-level code.

But there one unfortunate consequence of this style

1. There are to much boilerplate on the initiation stage.

Let's try...

## Dependencies

Here where `dependencies` library comes in.

```pycon

>>> from dependencies import Injector

>>> class OrderContainer(Injector):
...
...     order = Order
...     order_processor = OrderProcessor
...     price_calculator = PriceCalculator
...     payment_processor = PaymentProcessor
...     notification = Notification
...     logger = Logger

>>> OrderContainer.order.purchase(User(), Product(), ShipmentDetails())

```

It helps you to reduce the boilerplate of the initiation stage. It
doesn't require you to change your code. You still can to instantiate
your classes your self if you don't like this library.
