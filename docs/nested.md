# Nested injectors

Nested injectors supposed to be used as targets for `this` objects.

## Restrictions

You can't resolve nested injectors as main target of dependency injection.

```pycon

>>> from dependencies import Injector

>>> class Container(Injector):
...     class Nested(Injector):
...         foo = 1

>>> Container.Nested
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
_dependencies.exceptions.DependencyError: 'Injector' dependencies could only be used to instantiate classes

```
