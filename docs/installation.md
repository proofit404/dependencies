# Installation

The `dependencies` library is available on PyPI.

To install it run:

```bash
pip install -U dependencies
```

We use [semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
to publish packages as soon as pull requests land to the release branch. It's
not necessary to use develompment version of the library.

We officially support three last minor releases of CPython interpreter and last
minor release of PyPy interpreter. We highly recommend the latest patch release
of each Python series.
