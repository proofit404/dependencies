# Installation

The dependencies library is available on PyPI.

To install it run:

```bash
pip install -U dependencies
```

We use [semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
to publish packages as soon as pull requests land to the master branch. It's not
necessary to use develompment version of the library.
